# IoT-Animal-Health-Monitoring
# Animal Health Monitoring System

This IoT-based project monitors the health of animals by measuring **temperature** and **heartbeat** using Arduino Nano and sensors. The readings are displayed on a 16x2 LCD.

---

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Nano
- DHT11 Temperature Sensor
- Pulse Sensor (SEN-11574)
- 16x2 LCD with I2C

## Software Used
- Arduino IDE
- Proteus (for simulation, optional)

---

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of animal temperature and heartbeat
- Display readings on LCD
- Easy to replicate using provided code and schematic
